<p align="center"><em>Hello, I'm the man who fixes problems (the right way). Is there a problem you have that requires fixing? Do you feel the need to deliver quality results over rushed ones? Do you require a fixer who is every bit as dedicated to the job as yourself? Then Hallelujah, you have come to the right place.
  Welcome to my GitHub profile!<br>
No bullshit stories of how good or I am or horseshit tales of happy customers (We leave that to the rookies), it's just you & my undivided attention - helping to make the world a better place, one line of code at a time. My motto is "If you're NOT grinding, then DIE!", if that ain't selling my dedication. I don't know what will.
  Feel free to explore my GitHub repositories to see some of my projects and contributions. If you have any questions or would like to connect, please don't hesitate to reach out. <br>
